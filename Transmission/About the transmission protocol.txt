The transmission prtocol functions as fallows...

when the encoder outputs to a bundled connection, it uses 10 wires. 8 of which are for data.
the first 8 wires (white, orange, magenta, light blue, yellow, lime, pink, and grey.) are the data bus.
the last 2 wires (red, and black.) are control wires.
the remaining wires are free for use, but may be used up in future iterations of this code.
if you want to you can go through the code and extend the databus to use 14 wires. but i recomended using 8.
